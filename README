cmpsat - Tool for Comparison of SAT Solvers
===============================================

This program is intended for comparison of two SAT solvers. It implements
the statistical methodology proposed by Mladen Nikolic (Faculty of
Mathematics, University of Belgrade, Serbia.) It can be obtained from
http://www.matf.bg.ac.rs/~nikolic/solvercomparison/.

This program uses ALGLIB (http://www.alglib.net).

Compilation
===========

To compile cmpsat, just type:
./compile


Usage
=====

To use cmpsat, type

./cmpsat data_file1 data_file2 num_used [bootstrapps]

num_used is the number of runtimes that will actually be used in the
comparison. It has to be less than the number of runtimes recorded for the
formula which can be found in the input file.

bootstrapps is the number of resamplings that will be used in bootstrap
estimate of the variance of r. If omitted or set to 0 jackknife estimate
will be used.

For sample data provided with cmpsat, one can run the comparison using 15
out of 50 available observations with jackknife estimate of the variance by
typing

./cmpsat sample1 sample2 15

Note: In this version the number of runtimes per formula should be the same
for both solvers. There is no theoretical reason for this. It is just the
current state of the program which is subject to change.


Input Format
============

One input file contains the data for one solver. It starts with the number of 
runtimes recorded for each formula. In each row of the input file, runtimes 
on one formula are recorded. Each runtime is followed by the indicator having 
value 1 if the runtime is exact, or 0 if it is censored. File containing 5 
observations for each of 2 formulae with used cutoff time of 1200 could look 
like this

5
533.23 1 1031.97 1 1200 0 1200 0 131.89 1
981.37 1 1200 0 1200 0 1200 0 387.82 1


Output
======

cmpsat outputs values of several statistics.

n is the number of formulae that are not discarded in the comparison.
z is the difference between observed and the expected test statistic
expressed in standard deviations.
r is the point biserial correlation estimate.
p is the p value for the test.
s is the estimate of the probability that the first solver solves the
formula in less time than the second.
